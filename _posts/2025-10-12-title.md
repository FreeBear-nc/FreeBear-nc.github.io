title: "Adding support for additional XYZ axes"

Extending the number of supported axes is limited by the alphabet. Some controls get round this limit by appending a back tick to the axis word.

Using a Bison type parser, this sort of extension is easy to incorporate at the lexing stage. Just need code at the lower levels to handle it. Using an F word to specify angular feed rates separate to linear feed rates also becomes a practical proposition.
` N3200 G1 X5 Y-2.4 F150 A45 F'360 ` becomes a possibility. Although handling moves that complete at different times is still problematic. Another area where back tick words could be used is with `G03 U4 V3 W7 R'5` to provide circular interpolation with UVW. Possibly extend this with `G'17` so that XYZ and UVW can interpolate circular moves in different planes.

All very non-standard, but it does demonstrate how easy it is to add new features when using a BNF parser as long as the rest of the code base is equally flexible.
